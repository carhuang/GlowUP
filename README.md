# GlowUP
GlowUP is a Chrome extension built during nwHacks 2018. 
It takes a picture of the user's face with the laptop's camera and uses the [Face API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/cognitive-services/face/) by Microsoft Azure to analyze the user's current emotion. Then, the app will generate a random [dad joke](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) if the user is generally happy; otherwise, the app will generate a gif related to the user's current mood using the [GIPHY API](https://developers.giphy.com/).
